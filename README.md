storybot
========
When users send a snap to the snapchat account linked here, the bot will upload the received snap to its Story.

First created by http://www.reddit.com/u/bicycle for /r/trees, but it can be used for anything.

To automatically upload all snaps received, you need to run a Cron job for some interval that performs "curl http://www.site.com/snapchatbot.php".

Supports both videos and images.
